autoCELLO
=====

Cello is a Framework for automated UI tests based on Watir-Webdriver and Selenium-Webdriver in ruby, extended by metaprogramming and magic to implement something based on page object model and describe the behaviour with cucumber.

This framework isn't realeased and stable yet, but the concept is already done. The concept consists in a way to implement tests faster like when we record using tools like seleium IDE, but using magic and metaprogramming instead all that terrible bullshit code generated by those tools.

The name is cello, not just because I love it, but because as a music composition are steps that, when syncronized guide the musician to play wonderful songs, the acceptance automated tests are steps that when syncronized guide the developer to keep coding wonderfull peaces of business value.

The core idea is based on two tecniques and a lots of ideas:
The first one is the Page-Object Model that provide a way to make tests more maintainable
The second one is the record but not replay that allows people without programming skills generate automated regression tests in a easier and faster way

No one technique is required, but the first one is really recommended

We still have to much work to do ( as you can see in right bellow in this document), but, if you want, you can fork it and have fun!

Is STRONGLY recommended do not use it for comercial projects, because it will change too much and we never tested it in a real project. We recomend you use it to emulate a project and, if possible, return us you example to be added on our library.

The way we choose to test our framework was . . . writing tests with it! This way we keep a stable version of it, we can overcome the limitations writing new features to cover the tests that wasn't working and build a library of examples to future users. 

So, that way, if you are not a developer but a awesome QA with a little experience with code, you can help us practicing this tool in a little bit in your free time, and we will try make you happy fixing the bugs and implementing the new features you find during the time you'll spend writing tests. This examples will be storage on our repository with your name, mail, blog link or what you want.

Gem: Creat the cello gem that will:
*Create project 
*Get a page and write the elements in the page
